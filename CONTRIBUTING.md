# Contributing to the project

First off, thank you very much for your interest
in helping the community around Company of Heroes.

Feel free make issues about anything.

If you know React, JavaScript but never worked with
Firebase, Cloud Functions, GCP or you would like to do any data changes
, see the database or other thing, don't hesitate to contact
me first.

## Before making MR

- Make an issue where you describe the changes
  you want to do
- Describe how you want to solve the problem

## MR Rules

- Make as small MRs as possible
- Top limit is 600 changed lines (unless you are adding new .json files or something)
- Make sure you have run linting `yarn fix` in root
- Make sure you are not adding more eslint warnings
- Try not to use ts ignore and any data types
- Feel free to open WIP MRs as early as possible if
  you are not sure about anything
